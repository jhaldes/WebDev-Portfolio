                <p>This is my RC plane. While it is incomplete right now, new scheduling due to the upcoming spring break may grant me some time to finish and fly the plane. Being my first custom built plane, it is a kit from the company <a href="https://store.flitetest.com/" style="color: #83868a; text-decoration: none;">Flite Test</a> that came with almost all of the electronics and all of the material to assemble the airfoil (the plane is a flying wing design so it is pretty much 100% airfoil).</p>

                <p>This is my science fair. Techincally, the paper is still incomplete, but the actual science fair design itself is finalized and is undergoing testing. The device measures conductivity to determine the prescense of salt in the water. This device could be useful in areas where road salt usage is high and they are unsure about if that road salt is causing runoff into the local water supply. Ultimately, though, it was not as successful as I wanted it to be due to the inability in picking anything but salts up.</p>

                <p>This is a part of the speech box that I made for my health teacher (Mr. Kim). He left, and now the location of the speech box is unknown, but it may still be in his old classroom. While the project did not meet performace goals for a variety of reasons, we Ultimately got an A on it, and, in general, I am proud of it. That part specifically was a breakout board for USB C, which was planned to be used for data but instead went unused.</p>
